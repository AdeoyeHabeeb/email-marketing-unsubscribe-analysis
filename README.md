# 📧 Email Marketing Unsubscribe Analysis  

### 🔍 Overview  
In today’s digital world, keeping subscribers engaged through email marketing is harder than ever.

This project explores key factors that lead to email unsubscribes such as **campaign type**, **timing**, **engagement behavior**, and **user demographics**.  
Using **SQL for data analysis** and **Excel for visualization**, the goal is to identify patterns, explain subscriber churn, and propose actionable strategies to improve retention.
